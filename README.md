# Econometric Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of econometric analysis projects focusing on quantitative methods in economics and finance. Each project demonstrates different statistical and econometric techniques applied to real-world data.

## Projects

### [Salary Determinants Analysis](./salary-determinants/)
Analysis of factors affecting salary levels using Labor Force Survey data, including:
- Statistical analysis of salary distributions
- Correlation between salary, education, and geographic region
- Regression models to identify key determinants of salary

### [Time Series Analysis](./time-series/)
Analysis of economic and financial time series data, including:
- GDP growth modeling and forecasting
- S&P 500 volatility models (ARCH, GARCH, EWMA)
- Comparative analysis of forecasting methodologies
